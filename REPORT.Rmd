subtitle: "Training various machine learning algorithms to predict the next candlestick of the bitcoin price using various lagged features"
abstract: "This report explores how to get the best accuracy on predicting the next candlestick of the bitcoin chart using the previous ones. It compares different algorithms: Generalized Linear Model, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN and Gradient boosting and different number of lagged features. This project is part of the 'Data Science: Capstone' module of HarvardX PH125.9x from the edx platform."
