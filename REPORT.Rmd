title: "Bitcoin candlestick predictions using lagged features and machine learning algorithm in R"
subtitle: "Training various machine learning algorithms to predict the next candlestick of the bitcoin price using various lagged features"
abstract: "This report explores how to get the best accuracy on predicting the next candlestick of the bitcoin chart using the previous ones. It compares different algorithms: Generalized Linear Model, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN and Gradient boosting and different number of lagged features. This project is part of the 'Data Science: Capstone' module of HarvardX PH125.9x from the edx platform."

# Overview

This last years Bitcoin (BTC) has been gaining attention not only by retail investors but also by institutional investor. In 2025 we've seen the emergence of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) from institutions such as BlackRock, VanEck, Grayscale. With a market capitalization of about 1.68 billion in dollars at the time of writing, Bitcoin started as a peer-to-peer currency, a free alernative to centralized currencies controlled by central banks. It is now used more as an investment, a store of value and even considered as a strategic reserve assets by some countries. 

TODO: Add examples with sources.

Bitcoin ows is decentralization and  to it's data structure, the blockchain, a chain of block that contains transaction, and to its consensus, the proof of work. Without going too much into details, it makes a Bitcoin a currency that does not rely on a centralized server. Proof of work is a cryptographic competition where the Bitcoin servers called nodes compete to decide which one is the next block to be added to the blockchain. They go through a process called mining where nodes have to use their computing power to find a number called nonce. This computing power is called the hashrate.
